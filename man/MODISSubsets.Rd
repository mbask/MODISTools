\title{MODIS Subset Tool}
\description{Uses the MODIS SOAP Web Service (see references) as a batch process to remotely extract and locally download time-series subsets of a MODIS product for a given area surrounding many locations.
}
\usage{MODISSubsets(LoadDat, FileSep = NULL, Products, Bands, Size,
SaveDir = ".", StartDate = FALSE, TimeSeriesLength = 0, Transect = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{LoadDat}{Input dataset: either the name of an object already in the workspace, or a file to be read in by specifying its file path as a character string, that has location data, dates (end date, and optionally start date) and study ID for each location. For required data organisation, see Details.
  }
  \item{FileSep}{If LoadDat is a character string that corresponds to a file path, choose the delimiter character for that file (e.g. "," for comma separated).
  }
  \item{Products}{Character string; a product code to request subsets from. The MODIS product table shows all available products and their respective product titles (see references). Data from multiple Products can be downloaded.
  }
  \item{Bands}{A character vector; each string a code to retrieve the desired data bands within the specified product to be requested. To get a list of the available bands in a product of interest, use GetBands(). Multiple data band across multiple products can be specified and downloaded at the same time.
  }
  \item{Size}{Numeric vector of two non-negative integers defining the dimensions of tile requested at each location. The first element identifies the distance from the centre to the bottom/top (in both directions), and the second element to the left/right (in both directions) in km. For example, Size = c(0,0) identifies the centre pixel only, whereas Size = c(1,1) identifies a tile of 2kmsq.
  }
  \item{StartDate}{Logical; indicate whether the input dataset contains information on the time-series start date. If StartDate = TRUE, start dates will be taken from the input data and will expect the data frame to have a column named start.date. Default is StartDate = FALSE, whereby the input data is assumed to have only time-series end date and the length of time-series recorded prior to that date is determined by another optional argument, TimeSeriesLength.
  }
  \item{TimeSeriesLength}{Non-negative integer; if StartDate = FALSE specified the length of time-series. Default TimeSeriesLength = 0, giving a time-series length of 1 year, taken from the beginning to the end of the year.
  }
  \item{Transect}{Logical; argument to be used when MODISSubsets() is called in MODISTransects() to merge all subset points for each transect into one file. Should not be optionally used - only useful for MODISTransects().
  }
}
\details{The data should be organised accordingly: "lat" and "long" columns showing WGS-1984 decimal degrees latitudes and longitudes respectively; "end.date" for study end date (and optionally "start.date"), that can be in years or in POSIXlt date format; "ID" containing a unique ID for each unique time-series (in time or space). Column names should be exactly as shown.
}
\value{An ASCII file written for each unique time-series (unique location, or unique time-series at a duplicated location), containing all data requested, for each band, for every pixel in the specified tile size. A subset download CSV file will also be written, that contains all the unique time-series information, and a status report for each time-series telling the user if the respective time-series was downloaded successfully or identifying any problems with that particular download.
